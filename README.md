# Tignum eslint-config

This package provides Tignum .eslintrc as an extensible shared config.

This is used by our frontend projects to implement ESLint rules to have consistent code and follow good practices based on [eslint-config-airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb)

## How to use

1. Install package
```
pnpm add -D @tignum/eslint-config
```

2. Create config file .eslintrc and add
```
{
    "extends": "@tignum"
}
```

### Prettier

Prettier is a high opinionated powerful automatic formatter. Eslinter is a code quality tool.
They can both live together but there are some compromises we have to do. We should disable
all the es-rules that are effecting the code formating and interfere with the prettier.

### How to update package

1. `git commit -am â€¦`
2. `npm version patch`
3. `git push`
4. `npm publish`


### Additional notes

- Make sure you add any additional rules and constants to `.eslintrc` that are specific to the project
- Make sure an `.eslintignore` is in place so that you target your eslint where needed
